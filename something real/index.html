       <h2>Dabira's opinion</h2> 
       <p>
       To me, food is something people cannot do without, it has served as a means of sustainance to men, a very essential component in nature.<br>Food is what has been keeping me alive till today, even though i dont eat very much of it... My type of food varies but my best food; is rice so long it tastes nice. The kind of rice i love most are;
       <ul>
        <li>Rice and Beans</li>
        <li>Rice and Spag</li>
        <li>Jollof and Fried rice</li>
        <li>Rice and Plantain</li>
       </ul>

       </p>
       <p>
        I will love to explore other types of rice.....<br> <p2>oluwadabira the rice ambassador </p2>
